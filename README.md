## setup

-   define the env variables and .env (as shown in .env.example)
-   setup the dashboard along with the information in the gas tank.
-    
## Current Status:
- currently facing issue in executing any function related to the creation of userOp or getting the current state of the information. it generated errors stating that "UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT" and "Create2 call failed". thus most probably there is the issue in the Smart Contract Factory contract.

## Run script

```bash
npm run go
```
